# Task-Board

## Description

I received the application's starter code and created a task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery.


## Tasks Completed

- Created a modal with a form to input a task title, task description, and task due date (using a Datepicker)
- Created task cards that are saved in its desired column when refreshing and saved to local storage 
- Created a delete button that updates to local storage so the task will not be added back after refreshing 
- Created a function that allows the task cards to be draggable and droppable 
- Created a function to color code the cards to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or overdue (red)
